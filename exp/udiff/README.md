## udiff


udiff is out CDC loop for the Vector format

varius exampels are there.

it allows any mutations on the frontend or backend to be real time synced between each other.

see ex folder for basic examples of checking the sync works. Its very simple but thats a good.

Need to integrtae this into the IDE.

Need a stepped GUI:
1. crate a new proejct or use an existng one.

2. then you see the files in the IDE via the watcher

3. tthan as you change / edit files, you see them update in the IDE as they run through the pipeline.

that the general idea.

its very simple. the workers pipeline can be nats based.
