# deck

We use Deck as one type of document types.

We need to add some things to it

- so we will ned to fork it and extnd it slightly.
- so make sure we have git commands for making forks easily.

We need it cleaned and cross compiled, ready to be used.
- use go.mk :)

We need the examples sucked out of the deck repo and put into this repo or another. Maybe for now just suck out 5 good examples that w can use. Later we can suck them all out and put into S3, so then users can get them easily when we have Cloud with minio running.
