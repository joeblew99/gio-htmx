# deck

We use Deck as one type of document.

We need to add some things to it.
- so make sure we have git commands for making that easy with forks.

We need it cleaned and cross compiled, ready to be used.
- use go.mk :)

We need the examples sucked out of the deck repo and put into this repo or another. Maybe for now just suck out 5 good examples. Later we can suck them all out and put into S3, so then users can get them easily when we have Cloud with minio running.
