## Events

NATS is a pub sub system that allows the GUI and the Backend "collaborate" over the documents changes.

There is no need for typical router setup because NATS is a virtual router, and so allowing use to do Per Project File based routing, which is exactly what we want.

An event holds:

- NATS topic: "Events"
- NATS Subject: "Project ID: document XMLPath"
- NATS Event Payload: "data of the event"

Sequence is like:

- GUI
  - Registers to Consume all Changed event for its Subject Namespace.
  - User changes a property
  - Publishes a Change event to NATS

- Service
  - Consumes Change event
  - Carries out the change to the document mutating a new document.
  - Diffs the old and new document.
  - Publishes a "Changed" event with the subject so the right consumer gets it. You could have 3 GUI open and they each are in change of only one Subject namespace.

- GUI
  - Consumes the Changed event.
  - Patches its document with the diff.
  - Renders.
