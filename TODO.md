# todo

basic scaffolds are done.

fix gio-build for windows so .syso files are deleted after build. It screws up the 2nd time you build.

scaffold out 3 pane gui. at the moment i just dropped in a GUI markdown demo to get the architecture joined up.

scaffold out basic nats just to get data flowing between client and server

add unified git diff lib, so that we can send deltas between client and server.
